## Data
The first part of the semester will focus on supervised classification. We consider several real world binary classification datasets taken from a range of applications. Each dataset is in the same format (described below) and contains a train, development, and test file. You will train your algorithm on the train file and use the development set to test that your algorithm works. The test file contains unlabeled examples that we will use to test your algorithm. It is {\bf a very good idea} to run on the test data just to make sure your code doesn't crash. You'd be surprised how often this happens.
